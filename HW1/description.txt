Problem 1:

First I set up a loop so that the program could repeat in case of a tie. My condition for the loop was a flag variable, where upon a winner being reached, would be set to false, thereby failing the condition and terminating the program. 

For the computer choices, I used the random function and the modulo operator as discussed in class.

Then I simply implemented the outcomes based on the possible player and computer values. 

Problem 2:

First I treated the case that the number of arguments was zero (no file name was given), and if there were, to terminate the program

Next, I checked whether the argument was not a file or directory, the argument was a file, or whether the argument was a directory.

If it was a file, I checked for read and execute permissions through the stat and cut command, which isolated the characters need. I chose to use the  

If it was a directory
