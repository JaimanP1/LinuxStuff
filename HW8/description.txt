Prob1:
For this problem, I first ensured that I understood how the mapping of the binary values worked. 
Then I made a serial count sort algorithm following the example in class. 
Finally I parallelized it. I used the MPI Reduce function in order to simplify the addition of the individual frequency arrays. 

Prob2:
I initially set up the problem to serially compute pi.
Then I added in basic pthread functionality to separate processes.
Finally I added a partial sum variable that could be computed for each process then summed it for the final value of pi
