First need to write a simple program that is able to read the binary data in file5k values. (done) 

Then I need to use count sort and write it to a binary file. (done)

Finally I need to parallelize it. 

Ascending order?

MPI part:
Each process needs the entire original array and a chunk of the counts array.
They then need to count the frequency for each of the indices of the counts array they have received.
They should finally return their portion of the counts array back to the main process.

What variables need to be broadcasted?
