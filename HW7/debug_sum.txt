Problem in filter function, should open ever be null
	Set a breakpoint
	Seems that iterator is null, suggesting open is null
		Turns out that it is
		Only gets reassigned in the merge_to_open method
			Set breakpoint
			Track open value
			Fix line
Segmentation fault at line 142

-----------------
On first pass, everything looks good in main

try tracking for iter > 0

seems that the program is moving away from the right solution 
suggests update or merge_to_open function is wrong 

update seems correct, gives reasonable values for configurations
means merge_to_open is most likely wrong

initialization and bubble sort portion as run in gdb seem correct
which means assignment to open is incorrect

turns out, am assigning to open in backwards order; highest f valued nodes are going first
switched comparison operation in bubble sort part so temp_list is backwards; assigns to open correctly now
